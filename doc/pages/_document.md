### `CustomDocument()`

This is a functional component that returns a custom Next.js `Document` component. It renders the HTML, Head, and body tags for the document. The `Html` component sets the language of the document to English. The `Head` component sets the meta description of the document. The `Main` component renders the main content of the page, and the `NextScript` component renders the necessary scripts for the page.

### `CustomDocument.getInitialProps()`

This is a static method that is used to fetch data and pass it as props to the `CustomDocument` component. It receives a `DocumentContext` object as a parameter, which contains information about the request and the response. It returns an object with the initial props of the `Document` component, as well as additional styles that are generated by the `createStylesServer` function from the `@mantine/next` library. These styles are added to the `initialProps.styles` using the `ServerStyles` component.
